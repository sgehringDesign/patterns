            <p>National security, border control, law enforcement, and emergency response organizations can’t always predict or control the data required for mission success. The data received can be videos, photos, or reams of text – in short, the worst type of data to put into tables in a relational database management systems (RDBMS).

            <p>MarkLogic, on the other hand, handles the complexity of today’s data – with all the enterprise-grade reliability needed to support mission requirements. Today, we provide a variety of solutions to some of the largest and most sensitive defense, security, and public safety organizations in the world.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="small-12 medium-6 columns">
            <p>These organizations turn to MarkLogic when they are fed up with the complexity and cost of adapting RDBMS and simple key-value stores to requirements built around variable and dynamic content. With MarkLogic, organizations can build out secure applications – including systems to support today’s current challenges in national security and public safety. Systems such as intelligence and crime analysis, military messaging, emergency response, object-based production, investigations management, and ad-hoc geospatial data capture can be implemented in weeks or months with MarkLogic, versus years with a traditional RDBMS.</p>
